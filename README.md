## Information:
- You are allowed to remove the linking in the footer that says I created it, but please leave some kind of link back to my website if you are nice :)
- Do not say that you created this. I have put lots of effort into it.
- If you are asking a question or getting support, please do it in the discussion OR my Discord
- The template, being PHP files now, requires a web server with at least PHP v5 or higher. XAMPP servers will work too. (You can't just double click and open in Chrome)
